# push_swap

Official description:
"_This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting._"

Given instructions:
<br>sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
<br>sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
<br>pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
<br>pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
<br>ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
<br>rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
<br>rr : ra and rb at the same time.
<br>rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
<br>rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
<br>rrr : rra and rrb at the same time

Methodology:
The main part of this project was use of _linked list_.
